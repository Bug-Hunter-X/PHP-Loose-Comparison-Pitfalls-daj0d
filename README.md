This repository demonstrates a common PHP error involving loose comparisons and provides a solution using strict comparisons. Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing strings with integers or booleans due to PHP's type juggling.  The example showcases a function that uses both loose and strict comparisons, highlighting the differences in their output. The solution demonstrates the best practice of using strict comparison (===) to avoid type coercion issues and ensure accurate comparison results.  This is crucial for preventing logical errors in your code.
